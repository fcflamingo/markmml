                the act of sending electronic mail or making an online contact, asking a question, and/or scheduling a consultation
                does not create an attorney-client relationship. The firm is under no obligation to respond to your messages,
                and if such response is given, that alone does not create an attorney-client relationship. The attorney-client
                privilege will not protect your message, as you do not have an attorney-client relationship with the firm solely
                as a result of your initial inquiry. If the firm and you agree to enter into an attorney-client relationship,
                you will be required to sign a written agreement letter which the firm will provide to you. The engagement
                letter will describe the matter upon which you initially engage this firm. You will be charged for professional
                services and advice pursuant to the engagement letter.<br><br>

                        <h2>Elizabeth Gregory</h2>
                        <p>I don’t think there’s anything interesting about me.I don’t like music; it jangles my nerves. I like interesting people. My favorite movie is Diva. My second favorite movie is 24 Hour Party People.
                        I can’t cook except on Thanksgiving. I can bake like a pro. This is because I can follow directions. I write a travel blog with my daughter called Wonderland And Back. I know most of the English Monarchs and all of the Mitford Sisters in chronological order. I’ve read all of Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Sir Walter Scott and Arthur Conan Doyle. I’m afraid that when I’m old I may turn into Miss Marple. I’m afraid that I’m more than half way there already.
                        </p>
                        <p>I have the free-floating morality that allows me to be able to work with people who regularly make unorthodox business and personal decisions without judging them, but I request that I not be held responsible when the results cannot be controlled and are not to the client’s liking. I started by representing such punk rock legends as The Jesus Lizard, The Cows and The Melvins, along with Mister Bungle. I have no idea how that happened. I’ve seen Steve Albini in his underwear backstage at CBGB’s. I don’t know how that happened either. I know what 8,000 booing people sounds like because my husband is in a band with Mike Patton.
                        </p>
                        <p>My husband is cult hero guitar player Duane Denison. I’ve had to deal with the police three times in my career, and every time involved one of my husband’s bands (but never my husband).
                        I have one client in the Country Music Hall of Fame, and one in the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame. Neither one is my husband.
                        </p>
                        <p>I go to Dose Coffee shop every single day. I’m a proud supporter of NPR and Nashville Public Television, but I’ve had it with both the Democrats and the Republicans. I'm a recovering control freak. I love to speak on panels, but am frequently mortified at the things I say. I’m a sucker for anyone who laughs at my jokes. I still use a blackberry because it has buttons and superior encryption. I’m perfectly happy being the only girl, but will leave the party if you start making sex and potty jokes. I believe in the Paleo Diet, but god, I’m always hungry. I’ve never done anything but worked in the music business.
                        I’m worth every penny.
                        </p>
