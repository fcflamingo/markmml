                                    industry. Priding himself on adding as much value to his clients’ lives as possible,
                                    David is often responsible for the assembling of a great team around an artist
                                    throughout the territories of the world, comprised of management, label, publisher,
                                    publicist, agent, and every other type of worthwhile opportunity a young artist
                                    could need--while at all times ensuring they are building a long-term career and
                                    not just a flash in the pan. Of course, he also diligently and comprehensively

                                    responsible for some of the most exciting music hitting people's ears rightnow.
                                    A musician himself, he goes about his role in a client's life with as much care,
                                    patience, ingenuity, enthusiasm, and empathy as possible.</p>
